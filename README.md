# Text-Summarization
This is a project on text summarization using open source llm models. In the ipython notebook we experimented on a pdf file using stuffdocument chain and map reduce. Next, it can take any url from youtube videos or any website and can generate a short summarization of it and it is hosted through streamlit app.
